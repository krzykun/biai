Implementation of a neural network that calculates an object's trajectory

Done:
* Basic structure of the net
* Test data and results for simple xor

TODO:
* Use data for object's trajectory
* dividing data into test and learning data
* try out different trajectories
* Check out other functions for back propagation
* Draw results chart
